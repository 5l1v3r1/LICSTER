# 3d Printed Case (Testing)

The 3d printed housing for the LICSTER testbed is currently only for **testing** purposes.

For the housing of the LICSTER testbed you are completely free.
Our first setup was mounted on a wooden plate to get a better overview.
In the meantime, we also have a 3d printed housing, which saves space, but of course is more difficult to reach.
